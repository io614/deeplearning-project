Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed.

The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region.

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer.

But a disciplinary panel ruled contact with the pupil was probably made and her conduct had been \"unacceptable\". On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed the suspension, saying: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom - but always denied hitting his head.

The government said extra funds were being given to early years providers to help children from poorer backgrounds and close the attainment gap. The report has also detailed a number of \"tests\" or benchmarks for the government's northern powerhouse scheme. Research by the IPPR showed only 47% of children born in the poorest families in the north of England achieved a good level of early years development compared with 59% in London. Its survey also found five northern city-regions combined had almost as many well-qualified individuals (3.6 million) as London (3.7 million) - but the IPPR forecasts demand for skilled workers in the North is set to increase.

The three-day event was launched by tourist body Welcome to Yorkshire after the county hosted the Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014. More than 1.2m people lined the 320-mile (515km) route. Mr Parnaby said last year's event had attracted thousands of spectators to the East Riding. \"The council feels that the investment made by the authority, circa \u00a3100,000, to bring part of the race here is money well spent and will provide opportunities for local traders to capitalise on increased spending and help boost the East Riding economy,\" he said.

Mr Hunt wants to change junior doctors' contracts, which he says are \"unfair\". The BMA said its door was open to talks and blamed the strikes on Mr Hunt's \"shambolic mishandling\" of the matter. The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT. Asking by Marr about low morale among junior doctors, Mr Hunt said: \"One of the reasons for that anger is that they were told by the BMA that their pay was going to be cut - it isn't. \"They were told that they were going to be asked to work longer hours - they aren't,\" he added.", "The launch of what was supposed to be its flagship model has turned into a fiasco for the world's largest smartphone maker.

It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service. It said that bringing them back would improve response times by about four seconds for the first engine to reach the scene.

On Tuesday evening, the FBI said it was investigating the incident. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters soon after the tweet was published that President Obama was fine, and financial markets quickly recovered the lost ground. AP said later: \"The @AP twitter account has been hacked. The tweet about an attack at the White House is false.\" The account was back online on Wednesday.

Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. \"In this context, green finance is a major opportunity. By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted,\" he said.

Tournament ambassador Hoey expects several European Tour winners to be in the Galgorm field. They are set to come up against several up and coming stars of the future. \"The NI Open will attract an even stronger field than in previous years,\" says five-time European Tour winner Hoey. \"Especially because it has such a good place on the schedule.\" Hoey's fellow Irish European Tour winners Peter Lawrie, Damien McGrane and Simon Thornton are all expected to compete while Walker Cup hero from 2015, Ardglass man Cormac Sharvin, is also likely to tee up. While Rory McIlroy and the other stars of world golf will be in action at the US PGA at Baltursol, there is no other event on in Europe during Northern Ireland Open week which could convince a number of well-known players to make the trip to the Ballymena venue. Hoey says that many of his peers have already", "Disguised as police, they broke through a fence on Monday evening and broke into the cargo of a Swiss-bound plane to take the gems, estimated to be worth $50m (\u00c2\u00a332m; 37m euros). They escaped back through the same hole. Police later found a burned-out vehicle close to the airport. Police are looking for eight men, a prosecutors' spokeswoman said. Caroline De Wolf, of the Antwerp World Diamond Centre, estimated the haul at $50m, saying: \"What we are talking about is obviously a gigantic sum.\" Earlier reports suggested the figure was even higher - with the Belgian state broadcaster reportedly putting it at 350m euros ($468m). AFP quoted an unnamed spokeswoman at the same Antwerp centre calling the robbery \"one of the biggest\" ever. She said that the diamonds were \"rough stones\" being transported from Antwerp to Zurich. Antwerp is the hub of the world diamond trade - about 150m euros' worth of", "The Lyndhurst Park Hotel, once linked to smuggling, was visited by Treasure Island author Robert Louis Stevenson. Developer PegasusLife wants to replace it with 74 pensioner flats. Opponents insist the unlisted building is historically significant and an influx of elderly residents would put pressure on services in the village. The plans to be considered by the National Park Authority (NPA) are open for consultation until early January. Originally named, Glasshayes House, the mansion house on the edge of Lyndhurst was built in the early 19th Century as a private home for railway entrepreneur Charles Castleman. Along with Louis Stevenson, its notable historical guests included Lord Carnarvon of Highclere Castle. It later became the Grand Hotel, and then the Lyndhurst Park Hotel. PegasusLife plans to replace it with 74 \"age restricted ... high quality assisted living\" apartments for which it said there was \"a very high need\" for, along with 12 holiday lets.

It had hoped to increase the number of turbines between Kent and Essex to 341. The area is the winter home of about 6,500 red-throated divers - at least one third of the UK's population. London Array said it had formally requested The Crown Estate to terminate the agreement for lease for the phase two area and had cancelled the grid capacity that was reserved at the National Grid substation in Graveney, Kent. The wind farm, 10 miles north of Ramsgate, Kent, was given the green light in 2006 on condition that phase two, to add an extra 166 turbines, would only go ahead if the red-throated divers were protected. The RSPB was concerned the population of the birds in the outer Thames estuary could be displaced by the extension.

France, Germany, Finland, Canada and the USA are the others to withdraw from the event, which starts on 12 December. \"The safety of our players and staff remains our only priority and, at this time, we have real concerns,\" said England Squash chief, Keir Worth. \"Following the release of security plans for the event and subsequently a comprehensive report from independent security advisers, we have concluded that there is an inherent risk that has not been mitigated to an acceptable level. \"We have been through a significant consultation with the players and support staff over recent weeks and we are extremely disappointed to be withdrawing.\" England's four-man squad of Nick Matthew, James Willstrop, Daryl Selby and Chris Simpson were consulted by England Squash and agreed unanimously with the decision to withdraw. Simpson told BBC Radio", "The action targeted users of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) cyber-attack tools. Twelve of the suspects were arrested in the UK as part of an investigation led by the National Crime Agency (NCA). Authorities across a total of 13 countries made the arrests between 5 and 9 December. The NCA said that it had targeted users of software called Netspoof, a computer program that could direct huge volumes of internet traffic at websites and web servers in order to disable them. Following the UK arrests, a 27-year-old man from Hamilton in Scotland was charged with offences under the Computer Misuse Act.

The government says the move will make it easier for consumers to report nuisance callers. But the Fair Telecoms Campaign said the move would not stop cold calling. The Department for Communities and Local Government is expected to announce the amendment to existing legislation on Monday. The changes - to be announced on Monday - will take effect from 16 May. Baroness Neville-Rolfe, minister for data protection, said the change will sent a \"clear message\" to rogue companies. \"Nuisance calls are incredibly intrusive and can cause significant harm to elderly and vulnerable members of society.\" The government was committed to tackling the problem, she said. John Mitchison, from the Direct Marketing Association - which represents official telemarketing firms - said displaying phone numbers had been its recommendation to companies for \"many years\". \"This change will make it easier for consumers to identify the legitimate companies and report", "The hosts went in front through Harry Cardwell's close-range effort after half an hour. But Northern Ireland created plenty of late chances, with Fra Nolan's superb strike pulling them level after he had gone close on two previous occasions. Substitute Daniel Reynolds fired in the winner for the visitors with less than five minutes remaining. \"I thought at 1-1 we would see the game out,\" home boss Martin Cassidy told BBC Radio Jersey. \"I'm just disappointed for the players, they put so much in and deserved a draw at least. \"We gave them a game plan to stick to and they delivered it perfectly.\" The Northern Irish squad, who visit the Channel Islands annually as part of their preparations for the Centenary Shield tournament, had found themselves behind when Cardwell stabbed the ball into the roof of the net.

Ministers said on Thursday they would re-start talks if they focus on Saturday pay and unsocial hours. The BMA's junior doctors committee is due to meet to consider its response. Last Monday, the government said it was willing to pause the introduction of the junior doctors' contract in England for five days to allow for talks. The BMA also agreed to defer any new threats of strikes for five days. The BBC's health editor Hugh Pym quoted a source as saying the government's preconditions were seen as a complicating factor but that there would be \"clarity about the next steps by the end of the day\". Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has previously indicated the government is willing to compromise. \"We've already made three significant compromises on Saturday pay but what we can't do is have a system where hospitals can't afford to", "The Crewe United players were charged with bringing the game into disrepute for bets placed on their Irish Cup tie against Warrenpoint Town on 4 February. Attempts were made to bet large sums on more than four goals being scored in the game, which Crewe lost 5-0. The players are suspended from all affiliated football until 31 May 2018. The IFA's Disciplinary Committee also imposed fines of \u00a3400 on each player, whose names have not been released. Prior to Wednesday night's hearing, all five players admitted to a breach of rules but claimed they had acted independently in placing bets. However, committee members \"were not convinced\" this was the case, according to an IFA statement. \"The committee wishes to express its concern at the negative impact betting on games can have on the game and urges all clubs, officials and players to familiarise themselves with the rules and regulations in relation to football.\" Reaching the sixth round of the Irish Cup was seen as a significant achievement for the Crewe", "Hisense can make TV sets using the Sharp name thanks to a deal it signed with the company in 2015. Sharp said the TVs bearing its name broke US rules on electromagnetic emissions and that Hisense had made false claims about picture quality. Hisense said it \"categorically\" denied the claims made in Sharp's court papers and it would defend itself. As well as accusing the Hisense-made TV sets of breaking emission guidelines, Sharp said the devices also broke Federal Trade Commission rules on pictures sizes and did not meet wider industry standards covering device safety. Sharp's legal papers said its brand was at risk of being \"destroyed\" by the \"shoddily manufactured\" TV sets by the time the five-year deal ended. It wants Hisense to stop using the Sharp name. The legal action is believed to be linked to Sharp's efforts to rebuild itself after a long period of turmoil. Sharp signed the deal with Hisense to raise cash when it was facing financial problems.

He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to import cocaine into the UK in a \u00c2\u00a360m drugs plot between May and June 2013. Gerrard was jailed at Manchester Crown Court for 14 years. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said Gerrard travelled to Rotterdam and met international drug traffickers with the plan of importing drugs from Latin America to Europe. The NCA appealed for help to find him following an October 2013 raid on a cafe in the Dutch city. Police believe Gerrard and others were using it as a front for a drugs smugglers' global operations centre. When he handed himself in, Gerrard told officers the pressure of being on the run had \"got too much\" for him.

Mr Buhari, 74, left for London nearly a month ago - his second trip to the UK for treatment this year. His absence has led to some anxiety in Nigeria, Africa's biggest economy, with people speculating about whether he will be able to resume his duties. Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo is acting president, and has been widely praised for his handling of the country's economic crisis, following a sharp fall in the price of oil, its major export. Mr Buhari took about seven weeks of medical leave in January, and flew to the UK for treatment. When he returned home in March, he hinted that he had undergone a blood transfusion, but did not disclose his illness. He flew again to London on 7 May for further treatment, and has not indicated when he", "Media playback is not supported on this device Jutanugarn, 20, didn't drop a shot and made six birdies to move within sight of the tournament record-winning score of 19-under par.

Jutanugarn will become the first Thai to win a major tournament if she can protect her lead on Sunday. She missed a chance at the ANA Inspiration earlier this season when bogeying her final three holes, but believes she has learned from that experience.

Schemes in the Midlands and Yorkshire would be put on hold, he told MPs. Labour said it remained \"concerned\" about the future of the electrification of the Great Western line. Sir Peter Hendy will become the new chairman of Network Rail in place of Gwynedd-born Richard Parry-Jones. Mr McLoughin told MPs on Thursday that the planned programme of rail upgrades was being reviewed to \"get it back on track\". \"Electrification of the Great Western line is a top priority and I want Network Rail to concentrate its efforts on getting that right,\" he said.

Ms Davidson said he had instructed his funeral be held on a Friday. This was because parliament was not sitting, \"so the SNP wouldn't win any votes while Tories were here\". Ms Davidson told the service at Glenbervie Parish Church in Aberdeenshire: \"He was a proper true blue Tory who would go into bat for the team but never fell out with anyone while doing so. \"A Labour blogger said you could disagree with him without ever finding him disagreeable. \"The first minister said he was never afraid to stand up robustly for the causes he believed in - but always did so with good humour and respect for his political opponents.\" She went on to recall Kincardineshire-born former dairy farmer and grandfather-of-six Mr Johnstone's \"humanity, his decency and his sense of fun\".

The administration of US President Donald Trump has yet to comment on the Israeli vote, which was unanimous.

He said the noise of the shooting was \"deafening\" as he fell on his face and another man collapsed across his legs. He could hear the groans of his workmates. A police report at the time read to the coroner said: \"What happened then is perhaps the most savage and senseless single outrage in the present campaign.\" About 30 relatives and supporters watched from the public gallery at the coroner's court on Monday.

The independence referendum led to an increase in numbers of people registering to vote. Expanded electoral rolls were used to identify those who had debts. The Scottish government said local authorities would be compensated. The poll tax, or community charge, was abolished more than 20 years ago in 1993 after only four years in operation in Scotland. The unpopular poll tax, which replaced the rates system, was introduced by the Conservative Thatcher government in Scotland in 1989 before the rest of the country, sparking protests on the streets. The amount of poll tax arrears collected by local authorities across Scotland has fallen in recent years to less than \u00c2\u00a3350,000 in 2013-14. Some local authorities have ceased recovery of debts altogether.

Mr Malone said the problem appeared to be limited to Holy island, with users able to regain signal on the Anglesey mainland. He said more than 100 people had made complaints but no-one could get a firm answer on when the problem would be fixed.

The UK has accepted about 8,000 Syrian refugees since 2011, according to the UN. The US has taken just 12,000. And according to recent UN refugee agency data, no Syrian refugees have been resettled by China, Russia or any Gulf states.

The numbers suggest about 10 incidents per day are being logged, it said. Drone-based complaints include invasions of privacy, disputes between neighbours, near misses with aircraft and prison smuggling, said PA. The news agency said the total number of drone incidents was likely to be higher than the figure it had given because not every force it contacted with its Freedom of Information request responded. Growing use of drones could have a significant impact on personal privacy, Prof David Dunn, a politician scientist from the University of Birmingham, told PA. \"Previously you had a hedge, you had a wall and you could do whatever you wanted in your garden without people disturbing you,\" he said. \"That has changed because of drones.\" Many of the reports logged by forces involved arguments caused by drones being flown", "David Poole told Cardiff Crown Court he trapped Adnan Khalid, 27, who was charged with grooming a 14-year-old.

Jenny Watson, chair of the Electoral Commission, said the problems were down to a \"failure in planning\". \"There were delays in getting counting staff and counting agents appointed by parties into the venue, then there were insufficient staff to be able to recover from that,\" she said. \"Fundamentally that meant a local election count that had planned to take six hours took 23 and a half hours.\" She said the commission would be monitoring the council's response to the review.

The National Grid said the show would drive the biggest festive \"TV pickup\" - a sudden surge in electricity demand. The spike is largely down to viewers turning on lights and boiling their kettles straight after the programme. There is also a surge in the number of people going to the bathroom, which leads to a spike in the use of water companies' pumps, which draw electricity. The Great British Bake Off, the Strictly Christmas special and Call the Midwife are also expected to create high demand over the Christmas period.

Inspectors said the availability of new psychoactive substances (NPS) was undermining recent progress. Prison bosses said more work needed to be done to tackle the problem. The report follows an unannounced inspection of the prison, near Hatfield Woodhouse, in February. It found the number of violent incidents, fights and assaults had increased since the last inspection in 2012 and levels were also higher than at similar prisons. More on this and other local stories in South Yorkshire Peter Clarke, Chief Inspector of Prisons, said: \"There are real opportunities at Moorland to make progress, but the issues of NPS... have such a negative impact on prisoners' experiences. \"In particular, there is a real opportunity to make progress in embracing the prison's", "Last week, the High Court's rejected a bid by ministers to delay publication of the plan, which was prompted by high levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2). This means the document should be published in the next week. Courts had given ministers until Monday 24 April to set out the draft guidelines. But on the Friday before the deadline, the government lodged an application to delay release until after the general election on 8 June. They argued that publication would fall foul of election \"purdah\" rules.

It's proven particularly popular with DJs, inspiring tweets, mash-ups, videos and confusion. But what is it and why has it been taking the dance music world by storm? Surprisingly, the answer lies in the bus horns of Indonesia. Young people in Indonesia, amused by the local buses' customised horns, have been waiting by the side of the road for vehicles to pass, encouraging bus drivers to toot their horn when they did so. Videos depicting this craze have gone viral in Indonesia. Some held signs to better attract the attention of the driver - signs which said 'Om Telolet Om'. 'Telolet' is a word representing the sound of the buses' horns, while 'om' is a term for an older male, like 'uncle' or 'sir' in English. So 'Om Telolet Om' roughly translates as 'Sir honk", "Keith McDonald was also placed on the sex offender's register for 10 years after being told he had \"abused his position as an employer\". At Selkirk Sheriff Court the 48-year-old was found guilty of committing the offences at the Ship Inn in Melrose. He was human resources manager at the pub where his wife was licensee. The court was told he repeatedly indecently assaulted one female employee between 2001 and 2011 by touching her breasts and buttocks which meant she tried to avoid contact with him. In 2007, McDonald indecently assaulted another female by touching her in a sexual nature. She immediately left her job. He was also found guilty of uttering sexual remarks to staff members over a 10-year period and on one occasion exposed himself in front of members of the public and two female members of staff.

A lack of safe routes was cited by 38% as a barrier to cycling. Cycling Minister Robert Goodwill said his department's investment in cycling \"will help keep young cyclists safe\". The survey suggested that 44% of people in this age group never cycled and were therefore \"missing out on the benefits of cycling entirely\". However, Brake also found more people surveyed disagreed (59%) than agreed (41%) with the idea that current speed limits in their area are too fast for the safety of cyclists and pedestrians.

The 51-year-old pilot is currently in a serious but stable condition in hospital. The report says the Hawker Hunter's canopy was released at the initial impact. At this time fuel and fuel vapour was released and then ignited. The jet split into four parts and both Mr Hill and his seat were thrown clear of the cockpit. The report states: \"The investigation continues to determine if the pilot attempted to initiate ejection or if the canopy and pilot's seat were liberated as a result of impact damage to the cockpit.\" The AAIB's report also revealed there was no \"blackbox\" flight recorder on the vintage jet, however,", "His wife greeted him at their home in Toronto, Canada, and he was seen on the estate grounds by 14:00 (16:00 GMT).

Investors have also come on board to help finance the brewery, which is the only registered brewery in Aberdeen. Before the official launch this week, the brewery had been in operation for two months and in that time produced more than 20,000 litres of beer.

The figures also reveal that SSE has almost all of its customers on the most expensive form of tariff. 91% of SSE customers are on standard variable tariffs, compared to just 9% at First Utility. The number of people stuck on standard tariffs is controversial, as most fixed-rate deals are cheaper. In the UK as a whole, 66% of households are on standard tariffs.

Although they could not confirm the second murder, investigators said the teenager had claimed the woman \"put up more of a fight than the child\" and weighed some 120kg (19 stone).
