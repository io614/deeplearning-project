A second earthquake struck on Tuesday, nearly two weeks after an earlier one killed more than 8,000 people. A Nepali battalion are searching on the ground, while US aircrafts work in shifts to search for the missing crew. The air search had been halted overnight due to darkness, but resumed in the morning with the Americans deploying two Huey helicopters and two MV-22 tilt-rotor Osprey aircrafts. The missing US team had been working in the vicinity of Charikot, a village that has been hit hard, a spokesman for the US Pacific Command said. The helicopter was declared missing Tuesday evening, according to Pacific Command spokesman Major Dave Eastburn. It had been flying from Kathmandu airport as part of the US Operation \"Sahayogi Haat\", which means \"helping hand\" in Nepali. According to the Pentagon, there was talk of \"fuel issues\" heard over the radio by a nearby Indian helicopter before the flight went missing", "original_crit": 0.03035210259258747, "sampled": "Six US Marines and two Nepali soldiers were on board the helicopter as it delivered aid to earthquake victims.

But the rescuers who rescued the other five soldiers, including one sailor who lost his sight and his knee, were forced to pull together as they scrambled towards the ship, which was missing.\n\nThe two Nepalese men said they felt a strong quake and then saw blood on the ground and the rescue helicopter heading towards it.\n\nThere were no reports on the identities and exact number of people who were injured in the disaster as of the Sunday evening.
